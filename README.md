# Fish Breeding Datapack

A Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.1 datapack that adds fish breeding mechanics and dolphin breeding to the game.

## Why This Datapack?

In vanilla Minecraft, fish cannot be bred like other animals. While players can breed cows, pigs, sheep, and many other creatures, fish remain unbreedable. This datapack fills that gap by introducing a kelp-based breeding system for all four vanilla fish species, plus an optional dolphin breeding system using tropical fish.

## Features

### Fish Breeding
- **Breed all vanilla fish species:** Cod, Salmon, Pufferfish, and Tropical Fish
- **Kelp-based breeding:** Drop kelp near two fish of the same species to trigger breeding
- **Proximity detection:** Fish must be within 5 blocks of the dropped kelp
- **Breeding cooldown:** 5-minute cooldown between breeding (configurable)
- **Maturation cooldown:** 30-minute cooldown before offspring can breed (configurable)
- **Tropical fish variant inheritance:** 80% chance to inherit a parent's appearance, 20% chance for a random variant
- **Visual feedback:** Heart particles and XP orbs (1-3) on successful breeding
- **Stack-friendly:** Breeding consumes only 1 kelp from a stack

### Dolphin Breeding (Optional)
- **Breed dolphins:** Optional breeding system for dolphins (disabled by default)
- **Tropical fish-based breeding:** Drop raw tropical fish (the item, not bucket) near two adult dolphins
- **Adult-only breeding:** Only adult dolphins (Age ≥ 0) can breed; babies are exempt
- **Vanilla growth mechanics:** Baby dolphins use vanilla Age system and grow naturally
- **Breeding cooldown:** 5-minute cooldown between breeding (configurable)
- **Toggle system:** Enable/disable dolphin breeding independently from fish breeding

## Installation

1. Download the `fish_breeding` folder
2. Place it in your world's `datapacks` directory:
   - Single-player: `.minecraft/saves/<world_name>/datapacks/`
   - Server: `<server_directory>/world/datapacks/`
3. Run `/reload` in-game or restart the world

## Usage

### Fish Breeding
1. Find or spawn two fish of the same species in water
2. Drop kelp near them (within 5 blocks)
3. Watch for heart particles indicating successful breeding
4. A new fish will spawn at the kelp's location

### Dolphin Breeding
1. Enable dolphin breeding: `/function fshb:config/enable_dolphin_breeding`
2. Find or spawn two adult dolphins in water
3. Drop raw tropical fish (the item) near them (within 5 blocks)
4. Watch for heart particles indicating successful breeding
5. A baby dolphin will spawn and grow naturally over time
